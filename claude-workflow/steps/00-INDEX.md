# Claude Code Project Playbook — Tests First

This playbook gives Claude Code a **step-by-step** workflow to build the Smart PDF Parser with Docling.  
We start by **generating tests** (TDD) and only then scaffold and implement the project.

## Order of Steps
1. 01 Test Strategy & Coverage Map
2. 02 Test Environment & Tooling
3. 03 Test Fixtures (Sample PDFs) Generation
4. 04 Unit Tests — Core PDF Parser (Docling)
5. 05 Unit Tests — Smart Search Engine
6. 06 Unit Tests — Interactive Verification
7. 07 Property Tests, Edge Cases, and Performance
8. 08 CI Setup (pytest, coverage)
9. 09 Project Scaffold (src/, tests/, config/)
10. 10 Implementation Roadmap & Task Board

> Once all green, proceed to feature-by-feature implementation.
