# How Claude Should Use This Playbook

1. Open `steps/00-INDEX.md` and follow in order.
2. Write tests described in `04`, `05`, `06`, `07` before creating or modifying code.
3. When tests are ready, generate scaffold from `09` and implement until green.
4. Keep golden files small and stable; prefer deterministic assertions.
